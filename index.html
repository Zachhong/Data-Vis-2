                This map visualises the percentage of Australians engaged in either work or study across different states and territories in 2023. The map reveals disparities in engagement rates, with higher percentages observed in more urbanised regions, particularly along the eastern coast, compared to the rural and remote areas in central and northern Australia.
                <br> <br>While states like New South Wales and Victoria show relatively high engagement rates (around 83% and higher), areas such as the Northern Territory display notably lower levels of participation. This indicates that more work needs to be done to increase access to education and work opportunities, particularly in rural and remote regions.<br><br>Hover over a state or territory for more information.

                This bubble chart illustrates the employment outcomes for males and females across various fields of study in Australia for the year 2023. Each bubble represents the percentage of male and female employment in a specific field of study, with the size of the bubbles corresponding to the percentage of employment within each gender. Blue bubbles indicate male employment, while pink bubbles represent female employment. <br><br>
The chart highlights differences in employment outcomes between genders in various disciplines. For instance, traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering and information technology show a higher percentage of male employment, while fields like nursing and education exhibit higher female employment rates. <br><br>
Try adjusting the slider at the bottom to filter fields of study based on a minimum employment rate threshold, and toggle the dropdown menu to filter by gender if you desire.

                This stacked bar chart compares the average salaries of males and females across different fields of study in Australia for 2023. Each pair of bars represents a specific field of study, with blue bars showing male salary averages and pink bars representing female salary averages.<br><br>
The chart reveals significant gender-based salary disparities in several fields. For example, in areas like dentistry, law, and engineering, males tend to earn higher salaries compared to their female counterparts. In contrast, fields such as nursing and social work show smaller salary gaps. This visualisation provides a clear indication of persistent gender pay gaps in various professions, emphasising the need for continued efforts toward achieving pay equity across fields of study.<br><br>

                The chart reveals consistent differences in average scores across year levels, with Year 9 students achieving higher scores on average compared to younger students. Notable fluctuations are seen in certain years, such as the peak in 2017, after which results show a general decline across all levels.<br><br> 
                This is potentially due to the effects of COVID lockdowns and online learning (which is why 2020 is missing from this dataset).<br><br>

The scores are broken down by state and year level, highlighting variations in performance across subjects - notably the Northern Territory shows significantly lower average scores compared to other states, particularly in the earlier year levels.
